# Roblox-Client-Optimizer

RCO automatically tweaks FFlags to optimize your Roblox client.
The flags we edit are contained in our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/L8X/Roblox-Client-Optimizer/blob/main/ClientAppSettings.json).

Why don't you give it a try?

# What about Byfron?
RCO remains operational regardless of Roblox's new anticheat measures (known as Hyperion / Byfron) as we do not inject a DLL nor do we modify live client memory.

# Will I get banned for using this?
No, RCO's operations are fully compliant with the Roblox Terms of Service, as we use a method that Roblox themselves intentionally added to the client to modify flags.

# Issues? 
1. RCO itself *ONLY* works on Windows, though it should also work on custom Windows mods. (Only tested on 10) (Semi support for 11)
2. For Linux support, use https://github.com/vinegarhq/vinegar
3. For Mac support, use https://github.com/L8X/Roblox-Client-Optimizer-Mac
4. If your antivirus detected any of our files as malware, read: https://github.com/L8X/Roblox-Client-Optimizer/issues/40
