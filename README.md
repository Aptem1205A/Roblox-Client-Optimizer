# About RCO

RCO automatically tweaks FFlags to optimize your Roblox client.
The flags we edit are contained in our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/L8X/roblox-client-optimizer/blob/main/ClientAppSettings.json).

Why don't you give it a try?

Do you have any issues installing RCO? Read here!
1. RCO *ONLY* works on Windows, though it should also work on custom Windows mods. (Only tested on 10)
2. If you have UAC disabled, or you are using a custom Windows ISO that disables UACs functionality, run rco-installer-NOUAC-DONT-USE-UNLESS-NEEDED.cmd to install RCO, instead of the regular installer.
