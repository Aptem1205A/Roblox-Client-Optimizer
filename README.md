# roblox-client-optimizer

-- C++ Ver! --

1. Find installer zip in the github releases page
2. Unzip the 7z arhive (7-zip.org | or use winrar if ur a closed source cunt)
3. Run the .cmd/.bat file!
4. Should be all good to go!

Notes:
May take one minute from install to actually update the fflag list due to fflag list being updated automatically every minute

Wont overwrite current fflag list if one is present, updates when no fflag file is found...
Offline list is entirely unmaintained
  
--Old versions--

~~To use, run the .cmd script and watch it do the magic for you.~~

~~After that, play Roblox as you normally would, and loading games should be a bit quicker, you'll notice a few small improvements ingame too.~~

~~NOTE: Run this every time Roblox updates.~~
